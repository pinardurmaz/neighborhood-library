## Interesting Code Snippet

```java
public static Book findBookById(int id) {
    for (Book book : books) {
        if (book.getId() == id) return book;
    }
    return null;
}
Why this code is interesting:
I chose this code snippet because it shows how to efficiently search through a collection of objects. The method findBookById loops through the list of books and returns the one with a matching ID. Itâ€™s simple, clear, and shows how we can interact with custom objects using loops and conditional logic. This was one of the first times I worked with object lists like this, so it helped me better understand how to manage and search through data in Java.
